# Step-by-step Approach
## Start with a new vault
The best way is to start with a new vault. I named it **"WineCellar“**, which is much more appealing than "WineFridge“. Go to Settings (or Preferences at MacOS) &rarr; Options: Community plugins &rarr; Turn on community plugins &rarr; Browse and install and enable the six **plugins** Dataview, Metadata Menu, Quick Add, Paste image rename, Minimal Theme Settings, and Style Settings.

Then install the Minimal **theme**: Settings &rarr; Options: Appearance &rarr; Themes &rarr; Manage. Search for "Minimal“ and click on "install and use“. 

Let’s make some **folders** to start with (I use numbers at the beginning to have a proper sorting):
- 0_Collection
- 1_Wines
- 8_FileClass
- 9_Templates

Now we have to change some **settings**:
- Options: **Editor** &rarr; Display: readable line length &rarr; OFF
- Options: **Files and links** &rarr; Default location for new attachments &rarr; In subfolder under current folder
- Options: **Files and links** &rarr; Automatically update internal links &rarr; ON
- Options: **Files and links** &rarr; Subfolder name &rarr; labels
- Options: **Appearance** &rarr; Advanced: Windows frame style &rarr; Obsidian frame
- Options: **Core plugins**: Turn off Canvas, Daily notes, Graph view, Sync (if you saved your vault in an iCloud folder)
- Core plugins: **Templates** &rarr; Template folder location &rarr; 9_Templates
- Community plugins: **Dataview** &rarr; Enable JavaScript queries &rarr; ON
- Community plugins: **Dataview** &rarr; Enable inline JavaScript queries &rarr; ON
- Community plugins: **Dataview** &rarr; View: Display result count &rarr; OFF
- Community plugins: **Dataview** &rarr; View: Refresh Interval &rarr; 500
- Community plugins: **Dataview** &rarr; Tables: Primary column name &rarr; Wine
- Community plugins: **Metadata Menu** &rarr; Global settings: Excluded folders &rarr; Enter "9_Templates“ and press save
- Community plugins: **Metadata Menu** &rarr; FileClass settings: Class File path &rarr; 8_FileClass (and Save)
- Community plugins: **Metadata Menu** &rarr; FileClass settings: Default icon &rarr; wine (and Save)
- Community plugins: **Paste image rename** &rarr; Handle all attachments &rarr; ON
- Community plugins: **Style Settings** &rarr; Minimal &rarr; Dataview &rarr; Trim Dataview columns &rarr; OFF
- Community plugins: **Style Settings** &rarr; Minimal &rarr; Properties &rarr; Hide property heading &rarr; ON
- Community plugins: **Style Settings** &rarr; Minimal &rarr; Tables &rarr; Row lines &rarr; ON
- Community plugins: **Style Settings** &rarr; Minimal &rarr; Tables &rarr; Highlight active row &rarr; ON

## Template
The next step is to create our **template** for the tasting notes. Mark the folder "9_Templates“, right-click on the name and select "New note“. Name it "Tasting note“ and copy this text into this note:

```
---
fileClass: Wine
Name: "{{value:Winemaker}} - {{value:WineName}} - {{value:Vintage}}"
Winemaker: "{{value:Winemaker}}"
WineName: "{{value:WineName}}"
Vintage: "{{value:Vintage}}"
Type: 
Variety: 
Country-Region: 
Vineyard: 
Style: 
Price: 
PurchaseSource: 
PurchaseLink: 
Stars: --
ValueForMoney: 
Points: 
Buy: 0
Inventory: 0
---

## Tasting note
...

## Label
Label:: 
```

You can add more fields or more headlines, but it is a good starting point.

## FileClass

Now we are ready to set up our "FileClass“ for Metadata Menu. Next to the "8_FileClass“ you should see a "+“ sign, coming from Metadata Menu. 

![FileClass-Plus](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11a88b3b-b8ea-4fd5-b21d-2ff3c378f408)

Click on it and a window pops up, asking you for a fileClass name. Enter "Wine“ and save it. Now a new note was created in the "8_FileClass“ folder named "Wine“ with a wine glass symbol next to it. Whenever you click on this wine glass next to this note, you will see the fileClass details. You have to click on "FileClass fields“.

![FileClassFields](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a8c70e1-d2e8-40b3-8247-d882f8278b25)

With the "plus“ symbol we can now create all the fields we need. Let’s enter _Winemaker_ as "Field Name“ and press the save button. Go on with all other pure text fields (_WineName_, _Vintage_, _Variety_, _Vineyard_, _Style_, _Price_, _Points_, _PurchaseSource_, and _PurchaseLink_). 

The "_Type_“ field is a select field. So press "plus“, type "Type“ and click on "Choose a type“ and select "Select“. At the bottom of the window you can click on "Add a value“. In the new field type "Red wine“. The add the next value "White wine“, next value "Rose wine“, and "Champagne“. You can add other types later. Now save this field. 

"_Country-Region_“ is a normal "Input“ field, but add "{{Country}} - {{Region}}“ in the Template field. "_Buy_“ and "_Inventory_“ are fields of type "Number“. For both enter "1“ in the "Step (optional)“ field and "0“ at "Min value (optional)“. 

"_ValueForMoney_“ is a field I use with values from 0 to 5, so I add this field as type "Number“ with a minimum value of "0“ and a max value of "5“. The next field is "_Stars_“. Choose the type "Select“ and add 6 values ("--" (for non rated), "⭐️“, "⭐️⭐️“, "⭐️⭐️⭐️“, "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️“, "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️“). The last field is "_Label_“ of type "Media“.

So we have our basic settings, the template, and the fields defined. 

## QuickAdd
Now we can use our **QuickAdd** template. Go to settings &rarr; Community plugins: QuickAdd. Enter "9_Templates“ in the "Template Folder Path“ and activate "Show icon in sidebar“. 

Then type "Wine“ in the field on top of the QuickAdd settings window, check if "Template“ is chosen, and click on "Add Choice“.

Now click on the lightning icon and then on the gear icon in the new line above (with "Wine“) to configure your template. Enter "9_Template/Tasting note“ for "Template Path“, activate "File Name Format“ and type "{{VALUE:Winemaker}} - {{VALUE:WineName}} - {{VALUE:Vintage}}“ in the field. Activate "Create in folder“, enter "1_Wines“ in the folder field, and click on "Add“. Set "Open“ to ON and close this window (with the "X“ on top of the window). If the QuickAdd icon doesn’t show up in the sidebar, restart Obsidian.

## First check
Now it is time for a first check. Click on the QuickAdd icon in the sidebar and choose "Wine“. A window shows up to enter the _winemaker_’s name, e.g. "Alvaro Palacios“, then the _name_ of the wine, e.g. "Finca Dofí Priorat“, and the _vintage_, e.g. "2016“. And voilà: your first wine tasting note is there. If you like you can fill in the missing fields. For "_Country-Region_“ click on the pen symbol and a window pops up. Now you can enter the country ("Spain“) and the Region ("Catalunya“) and see the result "Spain - Catalunya“. When you have created more wine tasting notes you can just type in the field first letters and you can choose from the already entered values.

For _stars_ click on the chevron and select e.g. 5 stars. To test the following views set _type_ to "Red wine“, _inventory_ to 1, _buy_ to 1 and _PurchaseSource_ to "ShopA“.

With drag and drop paste your _label_ picture. On a Mac you can drag it from your photos app and drop it in your note directly after "Label::“. When you release the mouse button a window pops up asking you whether you want to rename the picture to "Alvaro Palacios - Finca Dofí Priorat - 2016.jpeg“. Confirm by clicking on "Rename“. And that’s it. 

For the labels I use "The Unlabeler“ app, because I want to have nice, flat, undistorted labels. Without the app you can just crop the image of the bottle to see (nearly) just the label, but it is still not nice:

<img width="370" height="518" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87cac3f0-3178-423c-94c4-fa4bee04afa0" />
.
<br/><br/>

With the app your label will look like this:

<img width="370" height="430" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6debfd2c-6173-449c-b10c-8e0637f6214f" />
.  
<br/><br/>

Additionally you can add a star rating, which is very nice for the card view, we will set up in a moment.

<img width="370" height="473" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/834025d7-556a-4558-a7cf-43d0070567a7" />
.  
<br/><br/>

Your wine folder should now look like this:
