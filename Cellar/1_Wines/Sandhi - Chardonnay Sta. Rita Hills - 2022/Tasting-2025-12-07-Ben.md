clear with a hint of honey
viscous

### Aroma
#peach
light #oak and #lemon
subdued

### Taste
#citrus
#oak 
#grasses
quite pleasant
low tanins
medium acidity

### Aftertaste
very smooth, mostly the same flavors

### Overall Impression
very impressed with this.  Not overpowered by the oak, quite deligtful.  The barest hint of tartness, but clean and creamy.  Delightful wine.  
I did notice I liked it less with my meal (which was a bit heavy for a white).
