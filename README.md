# My Wine Collection with Obsidian

## Introduction
A year ago, I started to dive deeper into the world of wine. I wanted to get a better understanding of the different varieties, the influences of the land, the winemaker, and the vintage. So I started to buy different wines at my local food store and tasted them one by one. After some months, I didn’t remember exactly which wine was good and which one was not. I made first notes with Obsidian, the number of notes increased (and the clarity decreased), I set it up again, … improved it, and now I have my final setup, which I wanted to share with you.

My setup is for wine, but you can modify it easily and track your craft beers, different coffee beans, whiskies, gins, or whatever you like. 

The setup has the following **features**:
- A complete list of all wines you’ve tasted
- Card view with all the labels
- “Fridge” view of the wines currently in your inventory
- Automated shopping lists for your favorite wine stores

I use Obsidian and the following plugins:
- ![Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- ![Metadata Menu](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu)
- ![QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd)
- ![Paste image rename](https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename)

and the ![Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) with its companion plugins
- ![Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)
- ![Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

Additionally, I use "![The Unlabeler](https://unlabeler.app/)" app (for iOS/iPad/MacOS) to get nice, undistorted, and rectangular wine labels. In the interest of transparency, I should mention that I'm the developer of this app.

To set everything up from the scratch I wrote a [step-by-step instruction](Step-by-step.md) with all plugins, settings and code examples. If you don't want to set up the vault manually, I made an [example vault](/Cellar) with the plugins and settings. Just copy it to your computer and open it with Obisidan.

Here is an overview of the final Obsidian Wine Cellar vault:
