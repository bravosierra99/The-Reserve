# My Wine Collection with Obsidian

## Introduction
A year ago, I started to dive deeper into the world of wine. I wanted to get a better understanding of the different varieties, the influences of the land, the winemaker, and the vintage. So I started to buy different wines at my local food store and tasted them one by one. After some months, I didn’t remember exactly which wine was good and which one was not. I made first notes with Obsidian, the number of notes increased (and the clarity decreased), I set it up again, … improved it, and now I have my final setup, which I wanted to share with you.

My setup is for wine, but you can modify it easily and track your craft beers, different coffee beans, whiskies, gins, or whatever you like. 

I use Obsidian and the following plugins:
- ![Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- ![Metadata Menu](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu)
- ![QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd)
- ![Paste image rename](https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename)

and the ![Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) with its companion plugins
- ![Minimal Theme Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings)
- ![Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings)

Additionally, I use "![The Unlabeler](https://unlabeler.app/)" app (for iOS/iPad/MacOS) to get nice, undistorted, and rectangular wine labels. 

To set everything up from the scratch I wrote a step-by-step instruction with all plugins, settings and code examples:
